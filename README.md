Spatial_Analysis_in_R_Learnr_Example

This is an example of a R Leanr tutorial from the Spatial Analysis in R workshop course I taught in Summer 2022.  The course is located here:

https://www.edmundseto.com/edmundseto/introduction-to-spatial-analysis-for-r-a-focus-on-environmental-health/

This the module 1. Introduction to R, which doesn't have much in it.  But, it's uploaded to Shinyapps.io and can be run from there.

I will upload another module from the course that has a bit more of Learnr features as a separate repository on my github account.
